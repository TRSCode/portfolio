                    <p>I am someone who seeks solutions. I have a diverse background through 28 years in the Army, 20 years as a Physician Assistant, and I have worked as a “grunt” all the way up to the C-suite. Over those years, I encountered many problems that would be handled easier and quicker with a tech solution which has led me to become a full stack web developer/programmer. As an end user, I wanted simple ways to accomplish tasks without redundancy. As a manager, I wanted quick and accurate oversight capabilities. I now can create both (and much more).</p>
